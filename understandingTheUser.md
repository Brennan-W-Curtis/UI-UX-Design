<!-- Understanding Empathy in UX Design -->

<!-- Empathy -->
<!-- The ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation. -->

<!-- Empathizing with potential users is important to every step of the design thinking process. Approaching UX research with empathy is makes it easier for you to solve the right problem. -->

<!-- UX design is not about solving problems we assume users want solved. It's about solving problems that users actually want solved. We might think we know who a user is and what they need but UX research reveals who they really are what they actually need allowing us to better empathize with the user. -->

<!-- The name UX design says it all: the user’s experience is at the center of how we design products. The best way for you to create great user experiences is to know and empathize with your user. -->

<!-- As a UX designer, empathizing with users enhances the products you create because you experience the product as your user does. The better you are at anticipating a user’s desires and needs, the more comfortable the user will feel with your design, and the more likely they will be to engage with your product long-term. -->

<!-- How to empathize with users -->

<!-- The ability to empathize with users is a skill that can be learned with practice. Here are six tips that can help you become a more empathetic UX designer. -->

<!-- Ask lots of questions. -->
<!-- As a UX designer, you cannot make assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address. Ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective. -->

<!-- Become more observant. -->
<!-- Shift your focus to the whole user and not just the words they are using. In interviews where the user is physically present or on a video recording, watching a user interact with you or your product can provide physical cues that can affect your research outcomes. To help capture observations, you’ll take detailed notes or even record your sessions with users. -->

<!-- Be an active listener. -->
<!-- Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with. Avoid getting distracted by where the conversation is going or what you might say next. In UX design, practicing active listening can help you get impartial feedback directly from your users, which you can apply to improve your designs. -->

<!-- Request input. -->
<!-- It’s important that the feedback you receive is objective and unbiased. Friends or colleagues often provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to support or please you. So, it’s important to request input from a variety of sources and a diverse group of users. When asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s actual thoughts on the experience or product. -->

<!-- Have an open mind. -->
<!-- We all have biases. Remember, a bias is favoring or having prejudice against something or someone, based on limited information. As UX designers, we have to set those biases aside to better empathize with others. Your goal is to understand users, not to complicate their feedback with your own opinions and emotions. -->

<!-- Keep current on UX research. -->
<!-- ollow researchers and join online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that affects UX designers and the users you’re designing for. Research is always changing and evolving as we understand more about human psychology. Staying current will give you an advantage in how you understand and interact with your audience. -->

<!-- Empathy vs. sympathy -->
<!-- Empathy is sometimes confused with sympathy, but the two terms don’t mean the same thing. Empathy means understanding someone’s feelings or thoughts, often by feeling the emotions yourself. Sympathy is the experience of showing concern or compassion without feeling the emotions themselves. -->

<!-- By empathizing effectively with your users and doing your best to understand their needs, you build a great foundation for a product experience that will help solve their unique problems. -->

<!-- What does empathy mean to you? -->
<!-- Designing with empathy will enhance the products you create. By building deeper connections with users, you’ll better understand their perspectives and pain points. Finding that connection early can guide you down the right design path and save you from extensive revisions of your product during a later phase of the design process. With a focus on empathy, you can design a product that offers users everything they need and more. -->

<!-- To really understand how users think and feel you need to talk to them directly. One way you can learn from real people about their needs is by conducting interviews. -->

<!-- Recruiting Interview Participants -->

<!-- As you start to think about conducting interviews for UX research, you might be wondering: How can I find and recruit people who want to be interviewed? -->

<!-- Determine interview goals -->

<!-- You want to ensure that the interviews you conduct are worthwhile, both for you and for the participants. To make the most of your time together, you need to determine clear goals for the interview. As a UX designer, what do you want to learn from the interviews? Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with? -->

<!-- Here are some examples of common research goals when it comes to empathizing with users: -->
<!-- I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve. -->
<!-- I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address. -->
<!-- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing.  -->

<!-- How to recruit participants -->
<!-- You might start with a screener survey to help identify the best candidates to interview for your research study. -->

<!-- Use a screener to select a representative sample of study participants -->

<!-- The participants you select for a research study should be based on your research goals and the target users of the product you’re designing. The best way to check if potential participants meet the study’s desired characteristics and represent a diverse set of backgrounds is by sending a screener survey. -->

<!-- Screener survey -->
<!-- A detailed list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential participants meet the requirements of the research study. -->

<!-- Whether you use a screener survey or just move straight to recruiting you should start with one important step, determine the interview goals. To determine the goals of the interview ask yourself questions like the following. -->

<!-- - What do you want to learn from the interviews? -->
<!-- - Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with? -->
<!-- - Are there any characteristics of users you want to interview? -->
<!-- - Why? -->
<!-- - How much information should we have to ensure we get a comprehensive and balanced set of data? -->

<!-- Screening participants often requires collecting demographics, which are the characteristics of a group or individual. Demographics that you might ask about in a screener survey include: -->

<!-- - Age -->
<!-- - Geographic Location -->
<!-- - Job title or industry -->
<!-- - Gender -->

<!-- It’s important to recognize that asking demographic questions can be a sensitive and challenging space to navigate. Be conscious and mindful of the questions you ask in screener surveys and how you ask them. Frame questions in a way that is respectful and inclusive, and make questions optional if they ask about demographic data. You might want to preface demographic questions with a short explanation of why the question is being asked. For example, “In the spirit of inclusive design, we are asking these questions to make sure we’re reaching out to a diverse group of people.” -->

<!-- Write a clear set of goals to explain why you are conducting interviews which will help determine the characteristics of participants who will be ideal for you to meet with. Interviewing participants with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities is extremely important to ensure that your designs are accessible and equitable. As you start recruiting aim to form a representative sample. -->

<!-- Representative sample -->
<!-- A subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group. -->

<!-- The participants in a representative sample should include user groups that have been commonly under represented in previous research. This lack of represention is often the result of biases due to age, race, gender, or ability. Having a diverse pool of participants to choose from will help you create great experiences for all users. -->

<!-- Creating representative samples often takes additional time, money, and resources that you may not have access to at the moment. Do your best you can with the potential participants in your networks who are available. -->

<!-- Once you've determined the goals of your interviews its time to continue the recruitment process, to do this we'll explore how to search for potential interview participants. In the real world there are lots of factors that determine how UX Designers find potential interview participants. -->

<!-- Find research participants -->

<!-- At this point, you’ve determined the goals of the interview, written interview questions, and created a screener survey to find a representative sample of study participants. You’re ready to start recruiting participants! -->

<!-- How and where you find research study participants depends on the company you work for, the type of product you’re designing, time constraints for the research, the project’s budget, and the accessibility of target users. Based on these project details, you can choose from a variety of ways to find research participants. -->

<!-- To begin your search start by creating a list of who you know personally. You can also ask people from your professional circles. -->

<!-- Personal network.  -->
<!-- As a UX designer in training, your personal network is a great way to find people to interview! Think about family, friends, managers, or (current and former) colleagues who fit the demographics of the target users you’re designing for. -->

<!-- Existing user base. -->
<!-- If you’re conducting research and creating designs for an organization with an existing user base, you’ll likely be able to recruit participants from that group of established connections. This might not be the case for your current project in this program, but recruiting from an existing user base is pretty common in the real world.  -->

<!-- Once you've compiled a list of people you know move on to people you don't know. Perhaps the easiest way to recruit participants outside of your immediate network is through social networks or online platforms. You can also connect with potential interviewees via professional networking websites like LinkedIn. Online groups based on persona interests are another great resource. -->

<!-- Online. -->
<!-- Alternatively, if you’re coming up with designs for an imaginary company or a newly established business, the easiest way to recruit participants for your study is online. You can use your own social media to find research participants. Or, there are websites created specifically to connect with research participants, like UserTesting or UserInterviews. You can also find online groups that have users with the demographic characteristics that you want to interview. -->

<!-- - Professional networking websites -->
<!-- - Online groups based on personal interest -->

<!-- Hallway testing. -->
<!-- If recruiting participants online doesn’t seem like an option, a less formal way to recruit for your study is to ask people in person. You can use a recruiting method known as hallway testing, which means asking people that pass by in the “hallway” to try the product you’re designing. Try to position yourself in a location where you’re most likely to encounter your product’s target audience. Hallway testing can be effective if you’re recruiting a small number of participants, if you have limited time, or if you want to conduct research for free. However, finding participants in this way is risky because the people you collect feedback from might not have all the characteristics of your product’s potential users. -->

<!-- Third-party recruiting agencies. -->
<!-- Some organizations have a budget to hire third-party research recruiting agencies. Recruiting agencies are useful because they save you time and can often reach a greater diversity of users than you might be capable of reaching on your own. You and your team may choose to connect with research participants through paid services like those mentioned above. -->

<!-- - Websites specifically to connect with research participants -->

<!-- Reach out to participants -->

<!-- With a decently sized list of people you can ask to participate in your interviews you may decide to reach out to these participants based on who's available or if you are sending a screener survey you might select the candidates who align best with your interview goals. Either way its likely that a few candidates will stand out quickly as ideal candidates. When you are ready reach out to each prospective participant. Once you’ve identified potential research participants, the most common way to contact them is by sending an email. -->

<!-- Start with a greeting that introduces the project and yourself as the researcher. Then briefly explain why you are reaching out to them. Include logistics for the interview like location, date, and time. Next explain the setup for the interview, this is a good time to explain any parts of the interview that you'll need their consent for like recording audio or video. Begin wrapping up your email by letting the participant know how they should confirm their interview time if they are interested. This can either be through a link to schedule their interview or through an email reply. -->

<!-- If you have the budget to provide an incentive to motivate or encourage people to participate in a research study, like a gift card, include that in the email, too. -->

<!-- Example introduction email -->
<!-- Hello [Participant Name], -->

<!-- I am currently working on a project for a [research] program where I need to conduct interviews about [explain the project]. -->

<!-- Your participation in the research study would be very valuable to help us [summary of project goals]. Details of the study are shared below. -->

<!-- Location: [Address and link to map] -->
<!-- Study dates: [Date range] -->
<!-- Time: [Time range] -->
<!-- Session length: [Estimated length of time for each interview] -->

<!-- With your permission, we will record each interview to help us decide how to improve our product. Recordings will only be shared with project team members for the scope of the project. A consent form is attached to this email that you need to sign and send back. -->

<!-- If you have any questions, please contact me through email at [your email address]. -->

<!-- If you are interested in being interviewed, please let me know when you are available between [date range of study] and the hours of [time range of study]. -->

<!-- Sincerely, -->
<!-- [Your name] -->

<!-- Prior written consent is required to record an interview, so be sure to attach a consent form to the email. If the participant is a minor or unable to consent under applicable law, then written consent is required from the participant's parent or guardian. -->

<!-- Consent Form Template: -->

<!-- After you confirm people to interview its a good idea to send email reminders the week before the interview and the night before the interview. This will help ensure the people you found actually show up for their interview. -->

<!-- Write interview questions -->

<!-- Keeping the goals of the interview in mind, you can write the questions that you’ll ask real people during interviews. The more aligned the interview questions are with your goals, the more useful the data you obtain will be. -->

<!-- There are a few best practices to keep in mind when writing interview questions: -->

<!-- Ask open-ended questions. -->
<!-- Open-ended questions allow the person being interviewed to answer freely, instead of with a simple “yes” or “no.” For example, if you’re designing an app to help people find dog walkers, you should ask “Could you describe your experience with finding and scheduling dog walkers?” instead of “Have you ever used an app to find a dog walker?”. Keep in mind that the questions you ask during interviews should not lead or pressure participants towards a desired response; instead, asking open-ended questions lets participants share their true thoughts and perspectives. -->

<!-- Keep questions short and simple. -->
<!-- It should be easy for interview participants to understand what you’re asking. -->

<!-- Ask follow-up questions. -->
<!-- During the empathize phase of the design process, interviews should be conversational, so encouraging participants to elaborate is a best practice. After a participant answers an interview question, try asking them “Why?” or use the phrase, “Tell me more about that” to keep the conversation flowing. -->

<!-- Research is an essential part of the UX design process and empathizing with users. Taking time to outline the goals for your research and recruit a representative sample of participants will help ensure the feedback you obtain is valuable. -->

<!-- Participant Recruiting Example -->

<!-- Interview goals: -->
<!-- I want to understand common challenges people face trying to manage a busy schedule and meal planning. -->
<!-- I want to identify frustrations people experience during the process of ordering from a restaurant. -->

<!-- Interview questions: -->
<!-- 1. Can you describe your current schedule and how you balance your responsibilities with meal planning? -->
<!-- 2. How often do you order meals from a restaurant? When you do, what is your motivation for doing so? -->
<!-- 3. What challenges do you face in the ordering process? How does this make you feel? -->
<!-- 4. Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be resolved? -->

<!-- Target participant characteristics: -->
<!-- Ages 18-62 -->
<!-- Lives in metropolitan or suburban areas -->
<!-- People who order food from restaurants at least once a week -->
<!-- Include participants of different genders -->
<!-- Include participants with different abilities -->

<!-- Whether you're conducting interviews in person or online preparing ahead of time helps you make the most of your limited time together and learn as much as possible about the interviewee's unique perspectives. -->

<!-- Conduct user interviews -->

<!-- As a UX designer, you'll always focus on the user and the experience they’ll have with the product you’re designing. In order to empathize with users and understand their pain points, you'll need to conduct interviews with real people who might use the product you’re designing. -->

<!-- Preparing for the interview -->

<!-- Whether you're conducting interviews in person or online, it’s important to be prepared before you speak with real users. You want to make the most of your limited time together and learn as much as you can about their unique perspectives. -->

<!-- Script interview questions. -->
<!-- Develop a list of questions that you’ll ask all of the users you interview. It's considered a best practice to keep interview questions fairly consistent across users, but this list of questions is just a guide. You can deviate from the questions you prepared, if necessary, to learn more about the user and their pain points. -->

<!-- Collect supplies. -->
<!-- Create a checklist of items you'll need for the interview, such as a computer, a printed list of questions, or paper and a pencil. If you're using new equipment or technology during the interview, make sure you know how it works in advance. -->

<!-- Research the users. -->
<!-- Take time to learn what you can about the people you’ll interview. If the users you’re preparing to interview provide their personal information before the interview, be sure to take note of it. This information might include their name, demographic information, relevant experience with the product you’re designing, or details about how they learned about the interview. You can use this information to extend the conversation during the interview and build a rapport. When you work for an organization, you can also screen participants on sites like LinkedIn to confirm they are who they say they are. You can also review their answers to a screener survey if you administered one before the interview. You wouldn’t want to accidentally interview someone who is working for the competition! -->

<!-- Practice. -->
<!-- It’s always a good idea to practice delivering the questions you’ll ask users before you conduct a real interview. This gives you time to make changes to the questions you’re planning to ask and helps ensure that the interviews run smoothly. Practicing is also a good way to determine if the length of the interview is appropriate, or if you need to add or cut questions from your list. You can practice asking interview questions in front of a mirror or with a trusted colleague. -->

<!-- Steps for conducting a user interview -->

<!-- 1. Meet the participant -->

<!-- First impressions matter! Your job as a UX professional is to make your participants feel relaxed and at ease. As you meet users for the first time, at the start of an interview, you want the conversation to be set up for success. Here are a few things you can do when meeting interview participants: -->

<!-- - Build a rapport. -->
<!-- Building a good rapport is all about establishing a professional, but friendly, interaction. Making light conversation, like asking how the user's day has been, can help establish a relationship before the interview begins. Simple questions and welcoming gestures can put the user at ease, which will help them share their true feelings once the interview begins.  -->

<!-- - Thank users for coming. -->
<!-- Before the interview begins, show gratitude to the people you’re interviewing for taking the time to meet with you and share their perspectives. Thanking users is a part of establishing a good rapport and can help them feel like their opinions are valued.  -->

<!-- - Review legal details -->
<!-- Take time to review legal details that your interviewees need to know before the interview starts. This can be a good time to present any legal documents that require their consent to release audio recordings. You can also have your participants sign a verification that they are above the age of 18 and don't need permission from a parent or guardian. -->

<!-- - Gather basic details. -->
<!-- As you meet users, remember to ask about basic information that's relevant to the interview, such as their name or demographic details. Starting with questions that are easy for the participant to answer can give them a nice boost in confidence. -->

<!-- - Let the participant know that there are no right or wrong answers -->
<!-- This way they are comfortable and are not worried about giving incorrect answers. -->

<!-- 2. Conduct the interview -->

<!-- Conducting interviews as a way to empathize with users is all about making the user feel comfortable and asking lots of questions. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind as you conduct interviews: -->

<!-- - Follow interview ettiquette -->
<!-- Speak in a clear and concise manner while asking questions, and remain professional no matter how users answer a question. Show that you are actively listening while users share their perspectives, such as nodding, making appropriate eye contact, or writing notes. -->

<!-- - Ask open-ended questions. -->
<!-- Avoid asking questions that would lead to a simple “yes” or “no” answer. Instead, try asking questions that start with “why” or "what." For example, avoid asking "Do you like going to the library?" you'll likely get one of two responses, yes or no. Instead ask "Why do you like or dislike going to the library?" Asking questions in this manner will allow for more detailed conversations and can reveal useful information to include in the product you're designing. It can also give you a more in-depth understanding of the user's feelings like, their likes and dislikes. If the participant does provide a short “yes” or “no” answer, you should ask a follow-up question to get them to share more. -->

<!-- 3. Take notes -->

<!-- Interviews tend to happen quickly. Without taking notes, recounting exactly what participants expressed can be nearly impossible! As you watch and listen to participants during the interview, write down as much as you can capture. A robust list of notes and observations will be helpful when you come up with ideas to solve users’ pain points. Here are a few best practices to help you take notes during interviews: -->

<!-- - Highlight compelling quotes. -->
<!-- The most obvious part of an interview is to take notes on what the user says. Interesting quotes are strong indicators about how users really think and feel. Including quotes in your empathy maps is a great way to feature a firsthand perspective from a real user, which can provide valuable insight when you begin your designs. It can be included in empathy maps and user testimonies later on. -->

<!-- - Document observations about participants.  -->
<!-- Sometimes what a participant does is equally important as what they say. It's important to record not only what users say, but also their mood, expressions, body language, and behaviors. Pay special attention to outside factors, like a noise or distraction, that might skew interview responses. All of these observations will be important to consider when creating empathy maps. -->

<!-- - Consider recording interviews -->
<!-- When you're first learning how to conduct research recording is ideal. Ask participants if they will allow you to record their interview. If they consent, recorded interviews can be really helpful later, for revisiting parts of an interview that you might not remember or taking additional notes after the interview concludes. -->

<!-- 4. Wrap up the interview -->

<!-- It's important to end just as strongly as when you started. Wrapping up an interview without showing gratitude to participants for joining the interview can leave them feeling uncomfortable or wishing they had not agreed to participate. Instead you want them to leave feeling like their opinions were a valuable contribution to your overall design process. -->

<!-- - Give users a chance to share any final thoughts -->
<!-- After you've asked all of the interview questions, give users a chance to share their final thoughts about any items discussed during the interview. Some participants might open up about their opinions and reveal insights that they didn't share earlier. You might try asking them if there are any new points they want to add -->

<!-- - Always thank the participant again for their time -->
<!-- Also, remember to thank participants once more. Tell them you apprciate them for participating in your interview and give them a warm goodbye. If you offered any incentives to your participants to interview now is the time to share them. You want participants to leave the interview feeling good about you, your future product, and the brand you might be representing. -->

<!-- Documenting user interviews -->

<!-- As you conduct interviews, it’s important to have a plan for documenting the information your participants share with you. -->

<!-- Recording the interview -->
<!-- One of the best ways to ensure all the information you need from your interviews is saved is to record the interview. Having a recording allows you the flexibility to revisit and easily pull important feedback even after the interview is done. This is especially useful if you’re conducting interviews on your own, so you don’t have to facilitate the interview, take notes, and digest the responses simultaneously. Here is what you’ll need to make a recording: -->

<!-- - Recording equipment: -->
<!-- The equipment you use depends on the type of interview and the data you want to capture. If the interview is in person and you just need an audio recording, you can use a mobile device or other voice recorder. To capture both audio and video, you’ll need to set up a camera beforehand. If you’re conducting a virtual interview, you can screen record the full interview. Whatever method you use, make sure to familiarize yourself with how the equipment works before the interview. -->

<!-- - Proof of permission: -->
<!-- It’s also necessary to secure permission from your participant before you record. A signed consent form is the safest way to do this so the interviewee is clear on the process and feels their privacy is being protected. Whether you secure permission in the days before or the day of the interview, it’s always good to begin the interview by confirming your participant understands how and what you’ll be recording. Remember, you want your participant to feel as comfortable as possible, so their responses will be honest and open. -->

<!-- Taking notes during the interview -->
<!-- Another tool you should use to capture important feedback from the interview is note taking. If you were conducting interviews for a company or with a team, you would probably have a dedicated note taker supporting the lead interviewer. This allows the lead interviewer to focus on the participant and move the conversation forward. -->

<!-- This can be as simple as jotting down bullet points of interesting quotes, recording quick observations, or writing down follow-up questions to ask the participant next. Recording the session relieves the pressure of capturing everything in your notes, so you can devote your attention to the interview. However, if a recording is not possible, make sure the participant understands that when you're writing or typing, it’s because you’re taking notes so you don’t forget any of the great information they’re sharing. -->

<!-- Documenting information after the interview -->
<!-- There are also some methods you can use to organize data after the interviews are done. One option is to create interview transcripts, which are a typed or written version of a conversation that’s been recorded. Interview transcripts can come in handy when you need to quickly and easily scan interview content to look for key quotes or feedback from research participants. However, transcribing interviews word-for-word can be time consuming, especially if you’re working by yourself. -->

<!-- However you organize the data, it’s a good idea to spend some time going back over recordings and adding to your notes after all the interviews are complete. This way you can be sure to capture the important information you need to help inform your designs. -->

<!-- Recording interviews and taking notes is a great way to save and revisit the information you gather from your participants. Though it can take some time to set up, it makes it easier to remember important quotes and help you identify insights across interviews. Your recordings and notes will be especially useful when you start to synthesize interview data later! -->

<!-- Build an empathy Map -->

<!-- There are many tools a UX designer can use to empathize with users. Interviewing users is essential to understanding users’ perspectives and learning about their pain points, but that’s only the beginning of the UX research process. -->

<!-- Empathy Maps -->
<!-- An easily-understood chart that explains everything designers have learned about a particular type of user. Empathy maps can help break down each interview into digestible pieces of information. It consists of four squares which shows what the user says, does, thinks, and feels. The word user goes in the middle right where these squares intersect. -->

<!-- Example interview -->

<!-- Imagine your company is building a new app for scheduling dog walkers. The purpose of the app is to match qualified dog walkers with customers who need help caring for their dogs, similar to a ride-sharing or home-sharing app. You’re on the UX team, and your team is in the early stages of designing the app and understanding user pain points. -->

<!-- A colleague has already interviewed dog owners and professional dog walkers who are expected to use the app regularly. It’s now your responsibility to summarize each interview using empathy maps. -->

<!-- Creating an empathy map -->

<!-- Step 1: Add the user’s name. -->
<!--  Include the name of the person interviewed in your empathy map. Having a name attached to it will help if you ever need to look back at the original transcript or research, and it’ll distinguish this map from other maps you create. -->

<!-- Step 2: The “SAYS” square. -->
<!-- The top left of your empathy map includes what the user says during the interview. Use verbatim quotes from the interview. In other words, write down exactly what the person said; don’t summarize it in your own words. If you summarize a quote, you might accidentally interpret the user’s meaning incorrectly. It’s also helpful to try to capture themes in the interview that relate to the product you’re researching. For example, if the user restates the same problem several times during the interview, then it’s probably a major pain point. Pay special attention to challenges your user states, and record any desired benefits or expectations they mention.  -->

<!-- Step 3: The “THINKS” square. -->
<!-- The top right square focuses on what the user thinks. Here, you can summarize the thoughts expressed by the user. This includes things the user doesn't actually say but you can tell through observation. Add feelings the user conveyed through body language, tone, or other noticeable indicators, even if they didn’t verbally express them to you. Facial expressions are a great way to understand what a user is thinking. You can make inferences for some of these feelings, but you have to be careful not to make assumptions about the user. For example, Makayla expressed concern about her neighbor’s teenage son and mentioned his age and qualifications. An assumption is that Makayla wants an adult dog walker. An inference is that she wants a dog walker with a car and a driver's license who can take the dog to the emergency vet. You can always ask your user for clarification on their body language if you find any contradictions. -->

<!-- Step 4: The “DOES” square. -->
<!-- Next the bottom left square focuses on what the user does. These can be actions or behaviors the user shares in their responses or even a user's physical actions during the interview. Makayla gave us quite a bit of detail on steps and actions she takes to overcome the dog-walking challenges she faces. All those actions can go in the “DOES” square. -->

<!-- Step 5: The “FEELS” square. -->
<!-- The bottom right square of the empathy map focuses on what the user feels. List the feelings the user expresses. The notes you include may overlap with some of what you listed in the “THINKS” square. That’s okay! This process is meant to be a thorough documentation of your observations. If you’re the person performing the interview, you might notice signs of feelings like anger, frustration, excitement, and others. You could directly ask the participant what they're feeling during the interview so long as its done in an open-ended way. If the user doesn’t explicitly mention any feelings during the interview, you can probe for feelings with the question: “How does this make you feel?” -->

<!-- This empathy map breaks down all the points that your team will need to determine how your app can meet Makayla’s needs. The real challenge starts when you lay out the empathy maps from all of your user interviews and figure out how each of your potential users’ needs overlap. -->

<!-- Types of empathy maps -->

<!-- It's important to understand that there are two types of empathy maps: one-user empathy maps and aggregated empathy maps (also known as "multiple-user empathy maps"). -->

<!-- One-user empathy maps are created by taking the feedback data from a single user's interview and turning it into an empathy map. This approach helps designers distill a single user's thoughts, feelings, and traits into a format that's easier to gather data from. -->

<!-- The other kind of empathy map, an aggregated empathy map, represents a group of users who share similar thoughts, opinions, or qualities. Aggregated empathy maps are created by creating multiple one-user empathy maps, then combining the maps where users expressed similar things into a new empathy map. This helps designers identify segments, or groups of people with similar tendencies, who will use the product. The insights in aggregated empathy maps allow designers to identify themes, which helps them better empathize with the groups they are designing for. -->

<!-- Aggregated empathy maps -->
<!-- Represent a visualization of everything designers know about an entire user segment or group of similar users -->

<!-- Aggregated empathy maps appear exactly like one user empathy maps breaking down the information we've learned about our user segment into four categories, says, does, thinks, and feels. The difference is that aggregated empathy maps is where you consolidate feedback from that is gathered from multiple users. -->

<!-- Creating an aggregated empathy map can seem overwhelming but keep in mind that you wanted to represent an entire user segment that your interviewed. As you think of ways to group your user feedback remember that each map should reflect a different user segment with specifc thoughts and needs. For example, if you find yourself interview a few users who find the app easy to use and have no real issues or complaints that user segment would be represented by a different aggregated empathy map then the users who are frustrated when they try to use the app. -->

<!-- Identify user pain points -->

<!-- Solving user problems is the ultimate goal of UX design -->

<!-- To make sure you are tackling something you can impact set clear and actionable goals by focusing on user problems. You need to do research to get into the user's head and understand where they're coming from. You also have to anticipate the needs the user's know they have and the needs they don't know they have. So if you narrow down everything a UX Designer does into a single role that role would be problem solver. -->

<!-- Pain points -->
<!-- Any UX issue that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need -->

<!-- Most pain points fall into one of four categories. -->

<!-- Financial, are user pain points related to money. -->
<!-- Product, these are usually quality issues related to the product. -->
<!-- Process, these are frustrations that stop the user going from point a to point b -->
<!-- Support, when users interact with your product they might have questions. If they can't find answers to their questions they wont feel supported. -->

<!-- Think back to an empathy map. Empathy maps show us what the user thinks, says, does, and feels. They help us get into the user's mindset allowing us to identify their pain points. -->

<!-- Pain points vs. solutions -->
<!-- When you can identify user pain points, you can develop more meaningful solutions. Get started by distinguishing pain points from solutions. -->

<!-- Pain point: I need to keep my food cold on a road trip. -->
<!-- Solution: I need a cooler to store and keep my food cold. -->

<!-- Pain point: I need to get from New York to Paris. -->
<!-- Solution: I need an airplane ticket. -->

<!-- Pain point: I need to stop my leg from bleeding. -->
<!-- Solution: I need a bandage. -->

<!-- Pain point: I need to connect with my family, located far away. -->
<!-- Solution: I need a video conferencing platform. -->

<!-- Paint point: I need to make a 1/4 inch hole. -->
<!-- Solution: I need a drill bit. -->

<!-- Review -->

<!-- Which of the following is an example of a pain point? -->
<!-- Unresponsive touch screen options and struggling to read the small text in an app. -->
<!-- These are examples of a product pain point, since this is a UX issue that frustrates the user. -->

<!-- Discovering the chat function on a site is switched off during the posted hours of operation. -->
<!-- This is an example of a support pain point, since the user can’t get the answers they need. -->

<!-- How can an empathy map help UX designers understand a user’s perspective? -->
<!-- It can convey to UX designers what users think, say, feel, and do regarding their experience with a prototype. An empathy map is an easily-understood chart that explains everything the designer learns about a user. -->

<!-- Which of the following is an example of a process pain point? -->
<!-- User faces difficulty adding an item to an online shopping cart. Process pain points are frustrations that stop the user going from point A to point B. If there’s an issue with completing an experience, such as moving an item to a shopping cart, that’s considered a process pain point. -->

<!-- Learn more about personas -->

<!-- Personas -->
<!-- Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. Each persona that you create will represent a group of users with similar characteristics that you’ve learned about through your research. Personas are key to the design process because they reflect the lifestyles of users and give your team an idea of how to meet users’ needs or challenges. -->

<!-- In the world of UX design, the user always comes first. But to put user needs first, we have to know who we’re talking about. -->

<!-- Personas can help us identify patterns of behavior in users. These patterns might point to a common pain point that a group of users experiences. While personas are fictional we don't make these characters up from scratch, we build them based on research. You've got to do your research if you want a set of personas that truly represent your potential users. As you research you'll form images in your head about who your users are, these will become your personas. -->

<!-- Building personas -->

<!-- Personas are created by conducting user research and identifying common pain points, which are UX issues that frustrate and block the user from getting what they need from a product. -->

<!-- To build a persona, first we'll need to figure out what user group our persona represents. -->

<!-- As you create personas, look for the most common themes in your data and group the users who personify those themes together. For example, imagine that the data collected from user interviews for the dog walker app shows that a lot of potential users between the ages of 45 and 60 are concerned about dog walkers having access to their homes. That would definitely be a pain point you’d want to include in a persona that represents that specific age group of users. -->

<!-- Generally, creating 3 to 8 personas is enough to represent the majority of a product’s user base. Think of personas as an overview of all of your research and interviews. While it’s important for personas to accurately represent users, it’s impossible to meet every one of their specific needs. Personas are also context-specific, meaning they should be focused on the behaviors and goals of users interacting with the product effectively. -->

<!-- For the dog walker app, think about a scenario from the perspective of a dog owner: -->
<!-- - Daniela is a 48-year-old freelance film producer who lives with their partner Priya and their two children in Atlanta, Georgia. The family recently adopted a golden retriever puppy named Cisco. -->
<!-- - The family takes regular trips with the kids for gymnastics competitions, and Daniela often travels for long periods of time when filming. Daniela wants to find someone to take care of the puppy, Cisco, while the family is away or busy. -->
<!-- - Daniela’s biggest concern is trusting a stranger to come into their home and to take care of their puppy. Daniela would be most comfortable hiring someone who knows how to properly care for puppies and can take Cisco on walks and to dog parks. -->

<!-- You can use the information in personas to create designs that speak directly to users, like Daniela. This ensures users have the best experience when using your product! For example, in your designs, you might want to indicate that the dog walkers are screened by the app and must pass background checks, which would reassure users like Daniela that their dog will be safe. -->

<!-- Here’s a pro tip: Get your team's opinion on the product’s users before you build personas. Then, after you build personas, review those suggestions from your team and compare them to the personas you created. Point out how the data validated or contradicted their suggestions. Everyone on your team needs to understand the personas in order to truly connect with your users. -->

<!-- There are many ways you can create personas. -->
<!-- Explore a variety of persona templates on the following website. -->
<!-- https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-persona-templates/ -->
<!-- https://xtensio.com/user-persona-template/ -->

<!-- User group -->
<!-- A set of people who have similar interests, goals, or concerns. -->

<!-- As we build our persona we want to include her photo and a short biographical sketch. Include things like age, occupation, home town, marrital status. and any other demographic data points that might give us a better sense of who our user group is. Keep in mind each persona you create humanizes a user group for your team. You wanto to build a persona to represent each key user group. -->

<!-- Benefits of personas -->

<!-- - Build empathy -->
<!-- By putting a face to the user they help humanize our users. They give stakeholders a clear idea of who their users really are and makes the user experience more meaningful.  -->

<!-- - Tell stories -->
<!-- This is why personas are key to turning an average stakeholder presentation into a storytelling experience. One persona isn't enought to tell all the sides of a design story. This is why you need a set of personas, all user groups should be vividly represented. This shows stakeholders the diversity of their user groups and let's you test features against them. -->

<!-- - Stress-test designs -->
<!-- Personas make sure we designers create something that benefits a wide range of users. -->
