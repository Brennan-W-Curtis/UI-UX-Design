<!-- Design Sprint -->
<!-- A time-bound process, with five phases typically spread over 5 full 8-hour days. -->

<!-- Design Sprint Goal -->
<!-- Solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. -->
<!-- It can answer critical business questions to design challenges. -->

<!-- Design sprints generally include 5 phases: Understand, Ideate, Decide, Prototype, and Test. -->

<!-- Design Sprint Benefits -->
<!-- Save Time  -->
<!-- Create a path to bring a product to market -->
<!-- Prioritze the user  -->
<!-- Test product before launch -->

<!-- Before launching into a design sprint you need to review your design challenge and ask yourself these key questions. -->

<!-- Are there many potential solutions to your design challenge? -->
<!-- Does the design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh in? -->
<!-- Is the design challenge's scope wide enough for a sprint? -->

<!-- A traditional design sprint lasts 5 days with each phases taking up to one full day. -->

<!-- The understand phase sets your sprint on the right track and helps your team get a clear picture of the design challenge. Your team takes time to learn from experts and engage in creative discussions with a lot of different people from other departments and industries. These conversations help you more clearly understand the design challenge. -->

<!-- Everything your team does during the sprint should focus on the user. -->

<!-- Start the ideate phase by coming up with ideas and building off of them to create solutions. Once you've got the team thinking each participant takes time to sketch and present their ideas. On top of all the ideating you also need to start planning for user testing. During user testing you'll have a diverse group of people test your product and provide feedback. To be able to do this you need to start recruiting users that fit your target profile now. -->

<!-- The design phase is where its time to decide which solutions you want to build. Finally, you'll wrap up by creating a step by step blueprint for your prototype. -->

<!-- With the prototype phase you're now ready to build your first version of your new product. During this phase you also finish prepping for user testing by confirming the test schedule and finalizing interview questions by making sure your prototype is good to go. -->

<!-- The test phase is where its time to put your prototype in front of users. As users test your prototype you observe how they react and then interview them about their experiences. Your team gains critical insight about changes that need to be made before your launch the new product. -->

<!-- Which design sprint phase helps a team gain a better idea of the design challenge by learning from experts in different departments and industries? -->

<!-- This is an example of the Understand phase because the team took time to learn from and engage in discussions with industry experts. These steps help team members understand the design challenge more clearly. -->

<!-- The 5 phases of Design Sprints -->

<!-- Understand the scope of the design challenge. -->
<!-- Ideate possible solutions. -->
<!-- Decide on the most viable solution. -->
<!-- Create a workable prototype. -->
<!-- Test that prototype with actual users. -->

<!-- Benefits of Design Sprints -->

<!-- It's all about the user -->
<!-- Value every person in the room -->
<!-- The best ideas will rise to the top -->
<!-- Time to focus -->
<!-- Lowers risks -->
<!-- Versatile scheduling -->

<!-- How does a design sprint solve design challenges? -->
<!-- They help designers choose the best design solution. Sprints can help designers decide on a solution, especially when there are multiple possibilities in mind. -->

<!-- Which of the design sprint phases involves creating the first version of the proposed solution? -->
<!-- During the Prototype phase a designer creates a first draft of the product to be tested by users. -->

<!-- In phase three of a design sprint—the decide phase—what is the team's goal? -->
<!-- In the third phase--the decide phase--the team’s goal is to determine which solutions to build for the user problem. This comes after assessing the user problem and brainstorming possible solutions. Phase three sets the stage for the product that will address user needs. -->

<!-- Why might a team consider conducting a design sprint? Select all that apply. -->
<!-- A team might use a design sprint to define product direction, develop cross-team strategies, or simply answer questions the team may have for the product’s development. -->

<!-- Plan Design Sprints -->

<!-- User research is always the first step in any sprint planning process. Your research should focus on the user problems you're trying to solve during the sprint. You don't have to detail out a specific problem right away but getting a rough idea of what your sprint will focus on will help you decide which research methods make the most sense. -->

<!-- Call the experts, it's up to you to schedule short talks with colleagues or industry experts. You'll listen to these info-packed talks during the understand phase. -->

<!-- Find the right space, its important to ensure the space allows all employees equal opportunities to perform their job. White boards to capture your ideas or hang sticky notes, acoustics so participants can hear each other easily. -->

<!-- When planning for a design sprint, what should you look for in a meeting space to ensure the best experience for all participants? -->
<!-- Spaces with accommodations for anyone who needs them are ideal spaces for design sprints because they ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to perform their job. It’s also a good idea to find spaces with comfortable furniture that can be moved around easily, and provide whiteboard to capture ideas. -->

<!-- Gather supplies, it's your job to make sure everyone has what they need to participate. -->

<!-- Establish the rules of the sprint, figuring out the ground rules in advance sets the tone for the sprint, gets everyone on the same page, and helps your team stay focused. -->

<!-- Plan introductions, this can be important since design sprints involve cross-functional teams that may have never met before. Choosing icebreaks that are relevant to your sprint can motivate your team and put them in the right mindset.  -->

<!-- Post-sprint planning, which means thinking about what will happen after the sprint wraps up like how your team might use what you've learned to acheive other goals. To do this you need documentation, make sure you list a few people to help document the design sprint by taking pictures, collecting sticky notes, and jotting down ideas. -->

<!-- Why is it important to call in industry experts when planning a design sprint? -->
<!-- Scheduling short, info-packed talks with experts can help solidify the purpose for the sprint. Experts can help clarify the problem you’re trying to solve.  -->

<!-- A design sprint brief is a document that UX designers share with participants to help them prepare for the design sprint. -->

<!-- A design sprint brief should include the current state of the project and an estimated launch plan, which are presented in the project overview section. -->

<!-- During the decide phase, the design team evaluates all potential solutions and votes for the one with the most potential. -->

<!-- Sprints at their core are about inclusivity. -->

<!-- It's always important to understand who your participants are and make sure that this overall experience is thoughtful. -->

<!-- Retrospective -->
<!-- A collaborative critique of the team's design sprint. -->

<!-- The goal is to make sure everyone who took part in the sprint has a chance to give feedback and think about opportunities for improvement. -->

<!-- Key Questions in a retrospective -->
<!-- What went well? -->
<!-- What can be improved? -->

<!-- Common Retrospective Questions -->

<!-- During a design sprint, the focus is on: -->

<!-- Understanding the design challenge -->
<!-- Ideating solutions -->
<!-- Deciding which solutions to build -->
<!-- Prototyping a few solutions -->
<!-- Testing those prototypes -->

<!-- Questions you might ask during this part of the retrospective include (What went well?): -->
<!-- Which tools saved you the most time and effort? -->
<!-- When did you feel the most satisfaction? -->
<!-- What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint? -->

<!-- This is also a good time to acknowledge a team member’s strong performance. Celebrating successes builds relationships and increases cohesion and harmony within the team! -->

<!-- Groupthink can occur in a group discussion when one person shares an opinion and everyone immediately agrees with the opinion, instead of sharing their own feelings about a topic. Groupthink prevents each person from having an equal say, and it might mean certain areas for improvement are overlooked. -->

<!-- Questions you might ask during this part of the retrospective include (What can be improved?): -->
<!-- What went wrong that caught you off guard? -->
<!-- Which problems came up the most often? -->
<!-- When do you think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team? -->

<!-- Then, examine the sprint’s outcome or final product, and ask questions like: -->
<!-- Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design? -->
<!-- Did an external factor derail your productivity? -->
<!-- And most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem? -->

<!-- By the end of the retrospective meeting, your team will have a better understanding of what went well and what could be improved. Naturally, you’ll want to take lessons learned into your next design sprint. -->

<!-- Questions you might ask include: -->
<!-- What did you discover during the sprint that you’re still wondering about? -->
<!-- How could the current process be holding the team back from creating better solutions? -->

<!-- Remember: Speak up and share your suggestions for how the next design sprint could be better. Don’t be afraid to suggest anything you think will improve the project or next sprint. The only bad suggestion is the one not shared! -->

<!-- Participating in a retrospective directly after a design sprint ensures all sprint participants have the opportunity to give feedback. Retrospectives are collaborative critiques of a design sprint that allow input from all participants. -->

<!-- Despite being a new or entry-level UX designer, you’ll be involved in every step of the decision-making process during a design sprint. -->

<!-- Design sprint retrospectives usually take place immediately after a design sprint, so that everyone’s thoughts and ideas are fresh. -->

<!-- Review -->

<!-- Identify questions you should ask during a design sprint retrospective. -->
<!-- By knowing what went well, we can repeat it or use it as a lesson for future work. Knowing what didn’t go well is the key to improvement. -->

<!-- Fill in the blank: In a design sprint retrospective, the team works together to review and critique what happened in the sprint the team just finished. -->
<!-- The retrospective is a collaborative critique of the design sprint a team just completed. Retrospectives take place immediately following the sprint. -->

<!-- Which is the first step in a design sprint? -->
<!-- Understanding the problem is the first step of a design sprint. In this phase, you take in all of the necessary data needed to move toward ideation and the other design sprint steps.  -->

<!-- Which of the following are important phases of the design sprint process? -->
<!-- It is through understanding the problem and then rapidly brainstorming ideas that we are able to come up with multiple solutions quickly. This makes it easier for us to decide what to move forward with and then prototype and test. -->

<!-- What is one step in a design sprint planning process? -->
<!-- You need the input of experts in order to understand what you will implement. Subject matter expertise will help you navigate both the users' needs and the business needs in order to deliver a successful product. -->

<!-- In the fourth phase of a design sprint, what task would an entry-level UX designer typically perform? -->
<!-- An entry-level UX designer in the Prototype phase would be actively involved in creating a solid prototype for users to try out. -->

<!-- When in the design sprint does the design team create a prototype? -->
<!-- In the decide phase, the team identifies the solution with the greatest chance of success. In the test phase, the team tests their prototype with users. Therefore, design teams create a prototype before the test phase and after the decide phase.  -->

<!-- Can design sprints help teams validate ideas and solve critical design challenges? -->
<!-- Yes. In design sprints teams can validate ideas, and solve design challenges, through prototyping and testing ideas with customers is one of the key reasons why design sprints are important. -->

<!-- In this step of planning a design sprint, ground rules are established in advance to set the tone for the sprint, get everyone on the same page, and help your team stay focused. -->
<!-- Figuring out the ground rules in advance sets the tone for the sprint, gets everyone on the same page, and helps your team stay focused. -->

<!-- What is a design sprint brief? -->
<!-- A document that UX designers share with participants to help them prepare for the design sprint. A design sprint brief includes information, objectives, and timelines to help participants prepare for the design sprint. -->

<!-- SPRINT CHALLENGE: Build exciting new feature for the productivity app in time for relaunch later in the year -->

<!-- What is the challenge that you want to solve in the sprint? -->

<!-- Here are four things that make a great challenge: -->
<!-- The challenge is something real that the team needs to deliver -->
<!-- It's states in a way that sounds inspiring - something to solve for -->
<!-- It's clear and concise -->
<!-- It includes a time frame (next quarter? 3 years from now?) -->

<!-- Example: Build an exciting new feature for a productivity app in time for relaunch later this year. -->

<!-- KEY DELIVERABLES: A complete prototype that includes the feature update -->

<!-- What do you want the team to create during the sprint? -->

<!-- A few tips for deliverables: -->
<!-- Aim for the highest quality deliverables possible. Polished digital work, videos, and interactive prototypes are better than sketches. -->
<!-- List all platforms that need to be designed for - e.g. web, mobile, tablet / physical product + website / environment -->

<!-- Example: Complete prototype that includes the feature update. Or user journey flows for X and Y. -->

<!-- We want to include this person's view in the sprint, so we can plan a path to launch that's fast and smooth. -->

<!-- RESOURCES: -->

<!-- For short term sprints: Assignment development team, if any: -->
<!-- It's recommended that you start a design sprint by having assigned development resources to carry the work after the sprint. This is easier in the case of short-term focused sprints. -->

<!-- For long term / vision sprints: Plan to secure resources: -->
<!-- Vision sprints take a long-term view of planning. In order to succeed, our team needs to have a plan of approvals for how to integrate the sprint within the organizational roadmap. -->

<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW: -->

<!-- 1. Current state of the project -->
<!-- What's been created already? -->
