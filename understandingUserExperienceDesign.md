<!-- The Basics of User Experience Design -->

<!-- User Experience -->
<!-- How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product. -->

<!-- Product -->
<!-- A good, service, or feature. -->

<!-- For a user to have a good experience the product needs to be usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. -->

<!-- User Experience is about improving usability or making something easier to use. This means that the design, structure, and purpose of the product are clear to everyone. -->

<!-- UX Designers need to think about every person who uses the product. This may include people with disabilities or people with very different life experiences from your own. -->

<!-- Being equitable means your designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. -->

<!-- User experience is also about making things enjoyable to use, which creates a positive connection between the user and the product. -->

<!-- UX Designers foster that positive connection by taking the user's thoughts and feelings into account when making products -->

<!-- To know how users feel we have to collect evidence on how they are experiencing that product in real time and ask them about it too. -->

<!-- As humans we want products that are useful, meaning they solve our problems. -->

<!-- When people like a product they use that product a lot and they recommend it to their friends and more people using the product means better business for the company. Plus when users have a good experience with a product they're more likely to have a positive opinion of the company that made it. -->
